## Introduction

Pseudofinder is a Python3 script that detects pseudogene candidates [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogene] from annotated genbank files of bacterial and archaeal genomes.

It has been tested mostly on genbank (.gbf/.gbk) files annotated by Prokka [https://github.com/tseemann/prokka] with the --compliant flag (i.e. including both /gene and /CDS annotations).

There are alternative programs for pseudogene finding and annotation (e.g. the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/]), but to the best of our knowledge, none of them are open source or allow easy fine-tuning of parameters.

Here is a video introduction of Pseudofinder: [Content](https://github.com/biovcnet/bvcn-binder-pseudofinder/blob/master/Lesson-8-PseudoFinder.pdf) | [Video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8sko_KEnD4)

Here is a hands-on tutorial (see 'Tutorial' section for more details): [Content](https://github.com/biovcnet/bvcn-binder-pseudofinder/blob/master/README.md) | [Video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtdr6EqOYU)

## Getting started
This section will guide you through setting up Pseudofinder and its dependencies on your machine.

### Easy Installation
Easy installation requires python3 and Conda already installed. This will install pseudofinder into your $PATH and take care of all dependencies. 
```
git clone https://github.com/filip-husnik/pseudo-finder.git

bash setup.sh

source activate pseudofinder
```

### Manual Installation
If you prefer to not use Conda, these are the dependencies that you must have to properly run Pseudofinder.

## Input Files
Pseudofinder requires the user to provide the genome in genbank format as well as a non-redundant protein database formatted for BlastP/BlastX searches. If possible, providing a reference genome allows Pseudofinder to include dN/dS calculations to identify pseudogenes.

### Genome Assembly Recommendations
We recommend several rounds of Pilon polishing with Illumina reads to improve your consensus sequence [https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/wiki], particularly if you're interested to find pseudogenes in minION/PacBio assemblies. However, Pseudofinder can also help with finding sequencing/basecalling errors potentially breaking genes in MinION/PacBio-only assemblies.

Genomes closed into one or several circular-mapping molecules (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) should be ideally oriented based on their origin of replication [e.g. by Ori-Finder 2; http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Ori-Finder2/] to avoid broken genes on contigs randomly linearized by the genome assembler.

### Annotation Recommendations
We recommend genbank (.gbf/.gbk) files generated by Prokka [https://github.com/tseemann/prokka] with the --compliant and --rfam flags. Annotating rRNAs, tRNAs, and other ncRNAs in Prokka is recommended to eliminate any false positive 'pseudogene' candidates. ORFs overlapping with non-coding RNAs such as rRNA can be sometimes misannotated in databases as 'hypothetical proteins'.
```
prokka --compliant --rfam contigs.fa
```
### Database Recommendations
Database selection is critical to the speed and sensitivity of Pseudofinder. Users can provide any database they would like provided it is a non-redundant protein database formatted for BlastP/BlastX searches, but must keep in mind that larger databases will increase runtime while smaller databases could suffer in sensitivity if they lack relevant protein sequences.  For those who don't have manually curated databases tailored to their specific microbe, we recommend NCBI-NR (non-redundant) protein database (or similar such as SwissProt).

Also to be considered is that while the pipeline runs using vanilla BlastP/BlastX, we have integrated Diamond which can be invoked using the '''--diamond''' flag and will significantly reduce runtime.

## Commands


### Annotate

<b>Annotate</b> is Pseudofinder's core command. Calling this command will identify pseudogene candidates in the input genome annotation, and will produce various output files, explained in detail below.

As with any other python script, there are two ways how to run it:
```
# Call it directly with python3 (or just python if python3 is your default).
python3 pseudofinder.py

# Or make the file executable and then rely on its shebang line [#!/usr/bin/env python3].
chmod u+x
./pseudofinder.py
```

Providing input files:
```
# Run the full pipeline on 16 processors (for BlastX/BlastP searches).
# Unless you have a $BLASTDB environmental variable set on your system, you have to provide a full path to the NR database.
python3 pseudofinder.py annotate --genome GENOME.GBF --outprefix PREFIX --database /PATH/TO/NR/nr --threads 16 
```

<b>Output of Annotate:</b>

Every run will produce the following files:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \[prefix]_intact.gff | Intact genes in GFF3 format. |
| \[prefix]_intact.faa | Intact genes in fasta format. |
| \[prefix]_intergenic.fasta | Intergenic regions in fasta format. |
| \[prefix]_blastX_output.tsv | Tab-delimited output of BLASTX run on intergenic regions. |
| \[prefix]_log.txt | Summary of all inputs, outputs, parameters and results. |
| \[prefix]_map.pdf | Concatenated chromosome map. Input genes appear on the inner track in blue, and candidate pseudogenes are shown in red on the outer track. |
| \[prefix]_proteome.faa | All protein sequences in fasta format. |
| \[prefix]_blastP_output.tsv | Tab-delimited output of BLASTP run on proteome. |
| \[prefix]_pseudos.gff | Candidate pseudogenes in GFF3 format. |
| \[prefix]_pseudos.fasta | Candidate pseudogenes in fasta format. |
| \[prefix]_dnds | Directory containing output from the dnds module: BLAST results, dN/dS summary file, and a folder containing the nucleotide, amino acids, and codon alignments that were used to calculate dN and dS values. |

### dN/dS
The <b>dnds</b> command will compare a genome against another closely-related genome. After homologous genes are identified, this module runs PAML on aligned genes to generate codon alignments and calculate per-gene dN/dS values. These dN/dS values can be used to infer neutral selection and potential cryptic pseudogenes. This module can be invoked within the <b>Annotate</b> command by providing a closely-related reference genome using the -ref flag.

Usage:
```
# Call within annotate
python3 pseudofinder.py annotate --genome GENOME.GBF --reference REFERENCE.GBF --outprefix PREFIX --database /PATH/TO/NR/nr --threads 16 

# Stand alone dN/dS calcuation
pseudofinder.py dnds -a GENOME_PROTS -n GENOME_GENES -ra REFERENCE-PROTS -rn REFERENCE_GENES
``` 

### Reannotate
<b>Reannotate</b> will run the <b>annotate</b> workflow, beginning after the computationally intensive BLAST and codon alignment steps. 
This command can very quickly reannotate pseudogenes if you would like to change any downstream parameters. The log file from the previous run will be parsed for previous parameters and files, so please keep the files in the locations described in the log file.

Usage:
```
pseudofinder.py reannotate -g GENOME -log LOGFILE -op OUTPREFIX
``` 

### Visualize

One strength of Pseudofinder is its ability to be fine-tuned to the user's preferences. 
To help visualize the effects of changing the parameters of this program, we have provided the <b>visualize</b> command. 
This command will display how many pseudogenes will be detected based on any combination of '--length_pseudo' and '--shared_hits'. 
Similar to the reannotate module, the log file will be parsed for information about relevant files and parameters.

Usage:
```
pseudofinder.py visualize -g GENOME -log LOGFILE -op OUTPREFIX 
```

### Test

With a single command, the entire Pseudofinder workflow can be run on the 139 kbp genome of <i>Candidatus</i> Tremblaya princeps strain PCIT (or optionally, you may provide your own genome).

Simply enter the following command:

```
python3 pseudofinder.py test --database /PATH/TO/NR/nr
```
The workflow will begin immediately and write the results to a timestamped folder found in ```/pseudo-finder/test/```.

## Acknowledgements

This code was inspired mostly by work on bacterial symbionts in early stages of becoming intracellular and strictly host-associated. This ecological shift releases selection pressure ('use it or loose it') on many genes considered essential for free-living bacteria, so relatively recent symbionts can have over 50% of their genes pseudogenized.

## Wish list
There are several additional features we'll try to include in the script in the near future.

1. Include an optional FPKM cut-off when there are RNA-Seq data available.

2. Improve logic for ORFs on contig ends broken by assembly issues (e.g. metagenome-assembled genomes).

3. Check if the ORFs called as pseudogenes do not represent individual protein domains that can exists and evolve independently of the rest of the original multi-domain protein chain (PFAM?)

4. Fine tune pseudogene finding for mobile elements such as transposases.

5. Visualize results by a scatter plot of all genes/pseudogenes (dN/dS, GC content, expression, length ratio, ...).

6. Sometimes ORFs are predicted by mistake on the opposite strand (e.g. in GC-rich genomes), check regions with ORFS with no blastP hits by blastX.
